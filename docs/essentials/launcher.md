# Xamarin.Essentials: Launcher

The **Launcher** class enables an application to open a URI by the system. This is often used when deep linking into another application's custom URI schemes. If you are looking to open the browser to a website then you should refer to the **[Browser](open-browser.md)** API.

## Get started

[!include[](~/essentials/includes/get-started.md)]

## Using Launcher

Add a reference to Xamarin.Essentials in your class:

```csharp
using Xamarin.Essentials;
```

To use the Launcher functionality call the `OpenAsync` method and pass in a `string` or `Uri` to open. Optionally, the `CanOpenAsync` method can be used to check if the URI schema can be handled by an application on the device.

```csharp
public class LauncherTest
{
    public async Task OpenRideShareAsync()
    {
        var supportsUri = await Launcher.CanOpenAsync("lyft://");
        if (supportsUri)
            await Launcher.OpenAsync("lyft://ridetype?id=lyft_line");
    }
}
```

This can be combined into a single call with `TryOpenAsync`, which checks if the parameter can be opened and if so open it.

```csharp
public class LauncherTest
{
    public async Task<bool> OpenRideShareAsync()
    {
        return await Launcher.TryOpenAsync("lyft://ridetype?id=lyft_line");
    }
}
```

### Additional Platform Setup

# [Android](#tab/android)

No additional setup.

# [iOS](#tab/ios)

In iOS 9 and greater, Apple enforces what schemes an application can query for. To specify which schemes you would like to use, you must specify `LSApplicationQueriesSchemes` in your `Info.plist` file.

```
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
<array>
    <string>lyft</string>  
    <string>fb</string>
</array>
```

# [UWP](#tab/uwp)

No additional setup.

## Files

This features enables an app to request other apps to open and view a file. Xamarin.Essentials will automatically detect the file type (MIME) and request the file to be opened.

Here is a sample of writing text to disk and requesting it be opened:

```csharp
var fn = "File.txt";
var file = Path.Combine(FileSystem.CacheDirectory, fn);
File.WriteAllText(file, "Hello World");

await Launcher.OpenAsync(new OpenFileRequest
{
    File = new ReadOnlyFile(file)
});
```

## Platform Differences

# [Android](#tab/android)

The Task returned from `CanOpenAsync` completes immediately.

# [iOS](#tab/ios)

If the destination application on this device has never been opened by `OpenAsync` from your application before, iOS will prompt the user once to allow your app to open it.

The Task returned from `CanOpenAsync` completes immediately.

More information about the iOS implementation is available [here](xref:UIKit.UIApplication.CanOpenUrl*)

# [UWP](#tab/uwp)

No platform differences.
