# Xamarin.Forms advanced concepts & internals

_Learn about advanced concepts and the internals of Xamarin.Forms._

## [Controls class hierarchy](class-hierarchy.md)

Learn about the hierarchy of types used to create the user interface of a Xamarin.Forms application.

## [Dependency resolution](dependency-resolution.md)

Learn how to inject a dependency resolution method into Xamarin.Forms, so that an application has control over the creation and lifetime of custom renderers, effect, and `DependencyService` implementations.

## [Experimental flags](experimental-flags.md)

Xamarin.Forms experimental flags enable the engineering team to ship new features to users more quickly, while still being able to change feature APIs before they move to a stable release.

## [Fast renderers](fast-renderers.md)

Learn about fast renderers, which reduce the inflation and rendering costs of a Xamarin.Forms control on Android by flattening the resulting native control hierarchy.

## [Source Link](sourcelink.md)

Learn how to debug your application into the Xamarin.Forms source code.
