# Theming a Xamarin.Forms application

## [Theme an application](theming.md)

Theming can be implemented in Xamarin.Forms applications by creating a [`ResourceDictionary`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.ResourceDictionary) for each theme, and then loading the resources with the `DynamicResource` markup extension.

## [Respond to system theme changes](system-theme-changes.md)

Devices typically include light and dark themes, which each refer to a broad set of appearance preferences that can be set at the operating system level. Applications should respect these system themes, and respond immediately when the system theme changes.
