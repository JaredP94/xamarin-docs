# Xamarin.Forms Shapes: Path

The `Path` class derives from the `Shape` class, and can be used to draw curves and complex shapes. These curves and shapes are often described using `Geometry` objects. For information on the properties that the `Path` class inherits from the `Shape` class, see [Xamarin.Forms Shapes](index.md).

`Path` defines the following properties:

- `Data`, of type `Geometry`, which specifies the shape to be drawn.
- `RenderTransform`, of type `Transform`, which represents the transform that is applied to the geometry of a path prior to it being drawn.

These properties are backed by [`BindableProperty`](xref:Xamarin.Forms.BindableProperty) objects, which means that they can be targets of data bindings, and styled.

For more information about transforms, see [Xamarin.Forms Path Transforms](path-transforms.md).

## Create a Path

To draw a path, create a `Path` object and set its `Data` property. There are two techniques for setting the `Data` property:

- You can set a string value for `Data` in XAML, using path markup syntax. With this approach, the `Path.Data` value is consuming a serialization format for graphics. Typically, you don't edit this string value by hand after it's created. Instead, you use design tools to manipulate the data, and export it as a string fragment that's consumable by the `Data` property.
- You can set the `Data` property to a `Geometry` object. This can be a specific `Geometry` object, or a `GeometryGroup` which acts as a container that can combine multiple geometry objects into a single object.

### Create a Path with path markup syntax

The following XAML example shows how to draw a triangle using path markup syntax:

```xaml
<Path Data="M 10,100 L 100,100 100,50Z"
      Stroke="Black"
      StrokeThickness="1"
      Aspect="Uniform"
      HorizontalOptions="Start" />
```

The `Data` string begins with the move command, indicated by `M`, which establishes an absolute start point for the path. `L` is the line command, which creates a straight line from the start point to the specified end point. `Z` is the close command, which creates a line that connects the current point to the starting point. The result is a triangle:

> [!NOTE]
> Path markup syntax is only available in XAML.

For more information about path markup syntax, see [Xamarin.Forms Path markup syntax](path-markup-syntax.md).

### Create a Path with Geometry objects

Curves and shapes can be described using `Geometry` objects, which are used to set the `Path` object's `Data` property. There are a variety of `Geometry` objects to choose from. The `EllipseGeometry`, `LineGeometry`, and `RectangleGeometry` classes describe relatively simple shapes. To create more complex shapes or create curves, use a `PathGeometry`.

`PathGeometry` objects are comprised of one or more `PathFigure` objects. Each `PathFigure` object represents a different shape. Each `PathFigure` object is itself comprised of one or more `PathSegment` objects, each representing a connection portion of the shape. Segment types include the following the `LineSegment`, `BezierSegment`, and `ArcSegment` classes.

The following XAML example shows how to draw a triangle using a `PathGeometry` object:

```xaml
<Path Stroke="Black"
      StrokeThickness="1"
      Aspect="Uniform"
      HorizontalOptions="Start">
    <Path.Data>
        <PathGeometry>
            <PathGeometry.Figures>
                <PathFigureCollection>
                    <PathFigure IsClosed="True"
                                StartPoint="10,100">
                        <PathFigure.Segments>
                            <PathSegmentCollection>
                                <LineSegment Point="100,100" />
                                <LineSegment Point="100,50" />
                            </PathSegmentCollection>
                        </PathFigure.Segments>
                    </PathFigure>
                </PathFigureCollection>
            </PathGeometry.Figures>
        </PathGeometry>
    </Path.Data>
</Path>
```

In this example, the start point of the triangle is (10,100). A line segment is drawn from (10,100) to (100,100), and from (100,100) to (100,50). Then the figures first and last segments are connected, because the `PathFigure.IsClosed` property is set to `true`. The result is a triangle:
